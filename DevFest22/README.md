What is Cython? 

Cython is a programming language that is designed to improve the performance of Python code. It is essentially a superset of the Python language, which means that any valid Python code is also valid Cython code. However, Cython adds additional features, such as static typing and the ability to call C functions directly, which can make Python code run significantly faster. Cython can be used to create high-performance Python modules that can be imported and used like any other Python module.
